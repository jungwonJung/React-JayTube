        "description": "The Exorcist: Believer\nOctober 2023\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.   \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own.  \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil.  \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. \n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend.  \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award® nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.   \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty.  \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment.  \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures.  \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever",

With new dual air intakes and dual throttle bodies, the 2024 Mustang GT makes more power and torque from its beloved 5.0 L Coyote Engine - pushing the numbers up to 486 hp and 415 lb ft respectively. But is it really all-new? And how does it compare to the previous generation? Thomas and James are eager to get behind the wheel of the latest pony car from Ford. We hope you enjoy the episode.
